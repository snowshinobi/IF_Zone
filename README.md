# IF_Zone
A hub for keeping track of my favorite Interactive Fiction works, plus some original work too.

## What is IF and Handy Resources
* Interactive Fiction ([IF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)) is a genre of books and text-based games; think choose-your-own-adventure stories with increased player input
* [IFDB](https://ifdb.tads.org/): where IF authors post their games free to play
* [Gargoyle](http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/): software that runs IF games files that do not have an in-brower play option
* [Borogove](https://borogove.app/): in-brower Inform editor

## Favorite IFs!
Include link and short description
* [An Act of Murder](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=x43lndv5htzy38w0) by Christopher Huang: a vivid whodunit story with nifty randomized elements
* [Galatea](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb) by Emily Short: an introspective modern take on the Greek myth 
* [Shade](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=hsfc7fnl40k4a30q) by Andrew Plotkin: surreal and existential; every detail rewards a second look
